			<h1> Major: Undecided; Finding your academic path </h1>
			<h3> By: Betty Kim </h3>
			<p>For many Dartmouth students, a drive to learn seems to come naturally; students are constantly engaged in a rigorous 10 week-term of three&mdash;or four&mdash; highly focused courses and several extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>However, once we try to trace back the intellectual motivation that fuels this constant &ldquo;grind,&rdquo; we might not always be sure why we do what we do. The phrase &ldquo;I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing with my life&rdquo; is surprisingly common among Dartmouth students &mdash; freshmen and seniors, students who have a top GPA and have a less-than-average one, students who have or don&rsquo;t have any idea what they&rsquo;re majoring in.</p>
<p>Both professors and students cited a liberal arts style education and an interdisciplinary approach as important factors in their learning, especially for students who were unsure which subject they wanted to pursue.</p>
<p>Dean of the Tuck School of Business Matthew Slaughter said he engaged in interdisciplinary learning during his undergraduate experience, specificially participating in a program called &ldquo;Philosophy, Politics and Economics&rdquo; as an economics major. According to Slaughter, interdisciplinary learning is important as it develops valuable life skills, beneficial to personal relationships and career skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially for undergrads, some version of the liberal arts is so vital for their development as human beings,&rdquo; Slaughter said. &ldquo;[They learn] how to understand how they view the world from a philosophical or theological perspective, and what role each student envisions playing in the world to make it a better place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even for students who are set on a particular academic track, Dartmouth&rsquo;s promotion of interdisciplinary work and collaboration is an essential part of an undergraduate learning experience. Kevin Kang &rsquo;18, a Goldwater scholarship recipient who will be attending Thayer School of Engineering for graduate school, said he knew he wanted to do biomedical engineering on the pre-med track but was also interested in other STEM disciplines. Kang said Dartmouth&rsquo;s academic plan provided the freedom to cultivate his diverse academic interests.</p>
<p>Similar to Kang, Brian Chung &rsquo;18 said he realized his sophomore year how grateful he was for Dartmouth&rsquo;s flexible curriculum. Now an economics major on the pre-med track, Chung said he came to Dartmouth thinking he would major in biochemistry and go straight to medical school after receiving his undergraduate degree. However, his experience in the Great Issues Scholar Living Learning Community exposed him to different fields.</p>
<p>Chung said the flexibility to engage deeply in his peripheral academic interests has shaped his undergraduate experience; he attributed his decision to major in economics to Public Policy 26, &ldquo;Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice,&rdquo; which exposed him to healthcare policy.</p>
<p>His interest expands outside of his major as well. Chung said he has never regretted taking any non-major classes, and, even as a junior, is considering modifying his current major with computer science. He has also taken a senior level art history seminar and has a self-professed obsession with hours-long Wikipedia browsing sessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you get out into the world your job will be your life; there are so few opportunities to learn or do anything outside your career, so I want to learn as much as I can before I dive into one career,&rdquo; Kang said. &ldquo;The best part [about life] is constantly enriching yourself as a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kang&rsquo;s exploration of different interests is not uncommon. In a campus wide survey fielded by The Dartmouth from April 16 to 20, 428 students answered questions about changes in their intellectual and academic pursuits while at Dartmouth. 48 percent of students have kept the major they started off with while 53 percent of students said they either changed their major or did not have an intended major when they first came to Dartmouth.</p>
<p>Apoorva Dixit &rsquo;17, a Fulbright scholarship recipient who is majoring in anthropology and minoring in public policy, wants to apply anthropology to issues of public and global health to bridge the gap between western science and world cultures.</p>
<p>Even as a senior, she said she is keeping herself open to many different tracks. Alhough she is ultimately interested in working in global health policy, she said she is looking forward to doing many different things in the future, such as a research project, healthcare consulting, and potentially law school.</p>
<p>For her research next year, she will be going back to her hometown, Hodal, India. Through her college experience, she said she found a major and an opportunity to dig deeper about family and community that she comes from. In fact, she said she surprised herself upon rereading her Common Application college essay recently and seeing she wrote about wanting to go back to Hodal at such an early stage in her academic development.</p>
<p>Similarly, many students at Dartmouth do not stop learning after they exit the classroom according to The Dartmouth survey; students devote an average of 6.28 hours per week to intellectual interests outside of the classroom. For Slaughter, students at the best schools do at least as much learning outside as they do inside the classroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Classroom learning builds a foundation of knowledge and frameworks,&rdquo; Slaughter said. &ldquo;But college is only for a finite amount of time, so an ideal liberal arts education sets up people to be able to speak and learn for the rest of their life &mdash; interacting with people &mdash; empathizing &mdash; looking at other perspectives and processing that information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For others, outside sources of inspiration completely unaffiliated with one&rsquo;s general field can help refresh and renew intellectual passion. Music professor Ashley Fure, who was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and awarded a Guggenheim fellowship, reported some stagnancy after entering graduate school directly after her undergraduate experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt like everybody was myopic; writing music to get that next commission, it felt insular and not inspirational to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was sickened by the culture and even reconsidered composing [as a] career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, she said she realized soon that this was not the ultimate choice she wanted to make, and found a personal &ldquo;intellectual renaissance&rdquo; in other forms of art. Taking a brief break from being constantly immersed in music, she read Virginia Woolf and Susan Sontag and browsed the art of Robert Rauschenberg. Doing this fed her sense of direction and eventually allowed her to rekindle her desire to make music, she said.</p>
<p>Fure elaborated, acknowledging that burnout is real and should be respected. However, she also said part of ensuring constant intellectual development is learning to recuperate quickly, crediting her experience in art school as what taught her to not &ldquo;wait around for inspiration to strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you can&rsquo;t muster that poetic insight, so you [take on] different aspects of the project, be it conceptual or expressive, pragmatic, or tactile,&rdquo; Fure said. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve grown as a musician, all of those muscles have gotten stronger; so there&rsquo;s this [same] thread of the desire to make the work, but my ability to execute it in greater and greater complexity has expanded since I was in undergraduate school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fure also emphasized the dampening effect that anxieties about career choice may have on intellectual passion, saying that questions of what students are truly enthusiastic about can often get tangled up with questions of pragmatics. However, she also encouraged students to consider embracing that uncertainty and &ldquo;taking the leap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These worries, however, do not appear to consume students&rsquo; intellectual interest, but seem instead to coexist with them. Only 1 percent of students reported that they took classes with only marketable skills and future financial success in mind. 20 percent reported they focused on both but more on practical skills, while 18 percent reported an equal focus, 50 percent both but more on intellectual interest and 11 percent only intellectual interest.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the percentages shifted towards intellectual interest when the classes had to do with a non-major class, with 59 percent of students reporting either only intelectual interest or more intellectual interest than easiness as their motivator for choosing non-major classes.</p>
<p>Regarding the pressures of career choice, Chung said that friends have reported feeling guilty about not knowing what kind of career they want after leaving Dartmouth, but encouraged students to continue exploring, as many people do not find their calling until they are in their middle years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either you can get left behind or keep up with the flow in any kind of burnout; you might lose that drive at Dartmouth, but sometimes I just have to remind myself that I have to exert myself in order to get where I want to be,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He said that the most effective way students can awaken themselves academically is to take every opportunity to pursue their interests, citing a lecture series he attended about the moral limits of economics as a major influence in his academic life.</p>
<p>Slaughter also encouraged this kind of humanistic engagement to foster intellectual engagement. He pointed to the importance placed on information technology&rsquo;s analysis of political behavior, rather than a much-needed focus on bringing together disparate voices and perspectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are subtle and not so subtle ways our culture and society values curiosity and asking questions and learning,&rdquo; Slaughter said. &ldquo;Advances in information technology are fabulous, but we&rsquo;re not quite sure as a society what that does to foster empathy and constructive discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like Chung, Dixit credited taking time to investigate something that catches one&rsquo;s ear to expand one&rsquo;s perspective, saying that the &ldquo;random&rdquo; classes or lectures she attended on a whim were often the most rewarding experiences.</p>
<p>Despite the various hurdles of academics and the fatiguing daily schedule of a college student, the continual search for academic awakening is a lifestyle for both professors and students of many different backgrounds. As Fure said, &ldquo;Passion doesn&rsquo;t look the same for everybody.&rdquo; However, Dartmouth is a place that constantly fuels and energizes this endless search.</p>

			<h1> 20 Things 20s Learned </h1>
			<h3> By: Cristian Cano </h3>
			<p>Freshman year is a time for many adventures, but above all, it is a time of learning.</p>
<p>For some students, living at college is the first time they&rsquo;ll be away from home. For others, attending college feels more like home than anything they have ever known before. But for everyone, college is where many lessons are learned. Hopefully, many of those lessons are academic &mdash; but the other lessons, of a more personal variety, are just as important.</p>
<p>As spring term comes to an end, The Dartmouth spoke to members of the Class of 2020, asking them what have been some of the most important lessons they&rsquo;ve learned since arriving at the College. These lessons touch upon different experiences, but they all reflect the many ways in which students grow during their first year.</p>
<p>Arriving On Campus:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;I brought way too much stuff. I brought a dozen pairs of shoes and way too many jackets that I only wear a few of, so now it&rsquo;s a very cluttered room for no reason. I guess it just extends to being over prepared in general.&rdquo; Nicholas Windham &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;How to live with a roommate in the same room. This is my first time living with another guy in the same room. We each have different schedules and lifestyles. I could never imagine living with a guy like this in my high school years. After a year, I feel like even though we have different schedules, things are likely to work out most of the time.&rdquo; Timothy Qiu &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;Try to make friends with upperclassmen. They&rsquo;re not as intimidating as they seem.&rdquo; Samuel Greenberg &rsquo;20</li>
</ol>
<p>Chances are, you were welcomed to campus by a mob of upperclassmen wearing outrageous clothing that you soon learned was called flair. Many freshmen embark on First-Year Trips before they truly settle into their dorm room &mdash; after five days with no showering and minimal access to toilets, even the worst of Dartmouth&rsquo;s dorms seem luxurious. Even if you didn&rsquo;t go on a Trip, though, move-in day is a blur of carrying boxes up never ending flights of stairs, meeting people, immediately forgetting their names and asking yourself if you brought too much or not enough stuff. (If you have to ask, the answer is probably yes, you brought too much.) Thankfully, there&rsquo;s nearly always a Crooling or O-Team member around once you finally swallow your pride and decide to ask for help.</p>
<p>Orientation week:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned the importance of finessing the Collis stir fry line. Like college, the stir fry line can be very intimidating and stressful, but over time and with the help of some friendly people, I&rsquo;ve really learned how to get what I want out of Collis.&rdquo; Emma Demers &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tenderbob with added hash brown. Prime.&rdquo; Dylan Giles &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;&lsquo;FOMO&rsquo; is a thing, but don&rsquo;t give into it. For every one thing you choose to do on campus, there are a hundred things you want to do but don&rsquo;t have time to do. I think it&rsquo;s important that you have to make so many decisions about what&rsquo;s the best use of your time and what&rsquo;s most valuable to you, because forcing yourself to make those choices will give you a chance to hone in on your interests and passions.&rdquo; Jessica Kobsa &rsquo;20</li>
</ol>
<p>Life at Dartmouth takes some time to get used to, and even something seemingly as simple as ordering food at Collis or the Hop isn&rsquo;t always straightforward. Thankfully, Orientation week gives students the chance to gradually acclimate themselves to their new home. In addition to the many required meetings, panels and information sessions that freshmen attend, there are also the many social events that introduce students to one of the most important aspects of college life: free food. There are so many activities that not even the most eager of freshmen can attend all of them &mdash; but thankfully, you don&rsquo;t need to make any commitments just yet. So take it easy, explore whatever sounds interesting and remember that there is never any shame in dedicating time to take care of yourself, especially while transitioning to college.</p>
<p>Classes and Clubs:</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>&ldquo;I learned how to enjoy myself. In high school, I didn&rsquo;t do that, but here I find that I have a lot more free time to do things that I enjoy doing, like making memes.&rdquo; Jeffrey Qiao &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;It never pays off to fall behind in your classes and then try to catch up.&rdquo; Nia Gooding &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;I discovered a lot of people that share many of my passions here, so I feel that it encouraged me to do better in school, study more and participate in activities. I felt that before, I wasn&rsquo;t in an environment that encouraged that, so it&rsquo;s been great to find people whom I feel I can share my passions with.&rdquo; Pedro Salazar &rsquo;20</li>
</ol>
<p>During orientation week, it is far too easy to forget that the primary purpose of college is to receive an education. Once the first day of classes arrives, however, that becomes more and more difficult to forget as your workload steadily increases. Classes at Dartmouth jump right into the course material thanks to the quarter system, which means that there is no such thing as a syllabus week. After a few weeks, however, students will get a sense of the pace of the academic schedule, while figuring out how to dedicate time to other interests. You might be the person who signed up for way too many clubs at the club fair or the person who didn&rsquo;t sign up for any; regardless, you can certainly check out both pre-existing and new interests. Again, no pressure: You can always drop out of a club or join another one later!</p>
<p>Discouragement and Motivation:</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>&ldquo;The presence of someone else&rsquo;s _______ is not the absence of your own. Fill in the blank however you want.&rdquo; Lola Adewuya &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s okay to struggle and to fail sometimes. I&rsquo;ve also learned that, while grades define your academic success at Dartmouth, your friends define the person that you are.&rdquo; Samuel Hernandez &rsquo;20</li>
<li>12.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that it&rsquo;s tough being in an Ivy League institution because when you come from a place where you&rsquo;re considered the top, and then you&rsquo;re suddenly not the top, it&rsquo;s tough accepting that.&rdquo; Jean Fang &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve learned over freshman year: even if you receive a midterm back and it doesn&rsquo;t go as well as you&rsquo;d hope, going to office hours can be very beneficial. Professors can be very helpful: they don&rsquo;t want you to fail, they want you to succeed. They&rsquo;re all very supportive.&rdquo; Meghan Poth &rsquo;20</li>
</ol>
<p>College is hard. The 10-week term moves quickly, and it seems like everyone else already knows the material even in the introductory level courses. Some groups are competitive to get into, and after a cappella auditions don&rsquo;t go so well, you might feel like never singing again. Even if you excelled academically in high school, you might get a less-than-stellar grade on your first midterms. You&rsquo;ve heard again and again that it&rsquo;s normal to struggle, yet it&rsquo;s still so hard to accept that it&rsquo;s normal for you. But as you begin to doubt your abilities and wonder if you made the right choice in coming to Dartmouth, you can also discover the importance of support systems. Whether your own support system comes from friends, family, professors, advisors, deans or a combination thereof, never forget that there are so many people, on campus and beyond, that genuinely want to help you succeed however they can.</p>
<p>Developing Priorities:</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>&ldquo;I have learned the importance of taking time to do things other than homework and to do things that are fun sometimes.&rdquo; Alexandrea Gosnell &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;A day that&rsquo;s no fun is a day without a pun. I&rsquo;ve really connected with people by making sure I say something nice about each person I see every day. That&rsquo;s either giving a genuine compliment or telling a funny joke.&rdquo; Sirey Zhang &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;I would say that there are some experiences that are worth pulling an all-nighter for. Like, &lsquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s go to the golf course at midnight. I have a bunch of work to do, but yeah, let&rsquo;s go do that.&rsquo; You know, just hanging out and thinking about life.&rdquo; Gregory Szypko &rsquo;20</li>
</ol>
<p>The sheer number of things to do on campus at any given moment is pretty overwhelming. There are performances to see, guest lectures to attend, games to play, books to read, research to do ... the list goes on. Once the frat ban is over, an entirely new option for socializing is available for &rsquo;20s to enjoy &mdash; or ignore &mdash; as much as they want. With all of these options, many first-years realize that they need to evaluate their priorities and adjust their schedules appropriately. That might entail quitting a club or two or limiting how often they go out. That adjustment could also be much more drastic, like spending less time with certain groups of people or changing academic interests. Such decisions differ from person to person because each person&rsquo;s priorities are different. With the power to plan their own schedules, first-years learn from experience exactly what they want out of college and out of life.</p>
<p>Life Lessons:</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t owe anything to the me I was yesterday.&rdquo; Mary Clemens-Sewall &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;One thing I&rsquo;ve learned over this year is that people cannot be put into boxes of good and bad. People are much more nuanced than that. Meeting so many different people coming from different backgrounds and talking to people with different beliefs to me has made me realize that that is simply not the case&rdquo; Naman Goyal &rsquo;20</li>
<li>&ldquo;When people say that everyone&rsquo;s experience is different than everyone else&rsquo;s, it actually means something. It&rsquo;s not just a clich&eacute; people say. Everyone comes from their own place, everyone has their own way of doing something, and that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Arunav Jain &rsquo;20</li>
</ol>
<p>Often, the most profound lessons are not taught explicitly but instead are slowly learned through a continual process of experience and reflection. There is no one way to experience freshman year at Dartmouth, and to that end, there is no single lesson that all freshmen must learn &mdash; nor should there be. Over the past year, each &rsquo;20 has learned many lessons: some funny, some lighthearted, all important.</p>
<p>I offer one final lesson, in my own words, that I have learned during my own freshman year. Being a first-year isn&rsquo;t always easy, but the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned have improved my life more than I could have ever imagined. I hope this one improves yours as well.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>&ldquo;No matter who you were when you arrived at Dartmouth, and no matter who you are now, you deserve to be here. Don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

			<h1> Coaches: On drawing the best out of their players </h1>
			<h3> By: Jonathan Katzman </h3>
			<p>Legendary college basketball coach Bob Knight once said, &ldquo;To be as good as it can be, a team has to buy into what you as the coach are doing. They have to feel you&rsquo;re a part of them and they&rsquo;re a part of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Knight&rsquo;s message elaborates on the type of relationship required between players and coaches for teams to be successful, it does not imply that there is only one way to coach a team. Whether or not they have previously heard Knight&rsquo;s statement, Dartmouth coaches across different sports have embraced the message&rsquo;s sentiments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Women&rsquo;s tennis head coach Bob Dallis just completed his 15th season at the helm of the program. Dallis is also one of the more seasoned coaches within Dartmouth&rsquo;s athletic department, with 29 years of experience as a Division I head coach and over 400 victories to his name. Since arriving in Hanover for the 2003 season, Dallis has coached his team to a share of two Ivy League titles -in 2011 and 2017- and overseen the development of numerous All-Ivy selections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So what has been the secret to the women&rsquo;s tennis team&rsquo;s success during Dallis&rsquo; tenure as head coach? Dallis, who has a doctoral degree in developmental studies and counseling with a specialization in sport and exercise psychology, insists that he is still learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Developing your coaching style is an ongoing thing,&rdquo; Dallis said. &ldquo;Certainly, I have always believed that working with a player&rsquo;s strength is important. Because players work and understand concepts differently, you never master it. Every player you work with is different for a variety of reasons, and they all grasp concepts at different times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The strategy he uses to unlock his players&rsquo; potential however, is remarkably simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Motivation is something that comes from within for each player,&rdquo; Dallis noted. &ldquo;Among the things I try to teach are love for your team, love for the game of tennis and love for Dartmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;One of Dallis&rsquo; most successful players in recent years is Jacqueline Crawford &rsquo;17. This season&rsquo;s co-captain and an All-Ivy selection, Crawford came to Dartmouth with a Women&rsquo;s Tennis Association ranking of 800 and a plethora of experience playing at the highest levels of junior and adult competition.&nbsp; Dallis&rsquo; coaching is something that she credits not only toward her own development as a student-athlete but also to her maintanance of a strong team culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I was lucky to have coaches traveling with me for most of my junior career, and they were entirely focused on tennis,&rdquo; Crawford said. &ldquo;Bob [Dallis] is not only a great tennis coach but also incredibly supportive in every aspect of our lives. He really emphasizes playing for each other and has allowed the players [to] shape the program&rsquo;s culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;On the court, Crawford also noted that Dallis&rsquo; most significant contributions to her game have not been technical adjustments but rather embracing her team&rsquo;s culture and strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;When you play singles in college, it is very different from juniors,&rdquo; Crawford said. &ldquo;If you lose your individual match, the team can still win. Dallis has facilitated my development into a team player and also done a great job of individualizing what I need to work on. He encouraged me to focus on strategy and stressed that the differences in my performance would not come from strokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Crawford&rsquo;s collegiate tennis career has not only been shaped by her individual performances but also being a part of a team. Dallis, as well as assistant coach Dave Jones, have played a foundational role in both.</p>
<p>Dartmouth football associate head coach, special teams coordinator and secondary coach Sam McCorkle utilizes a different method than Dallis does. The son of a football coach, McCorkle caught the coaching bug following his undergraduate days at the University of Florida, where he served as special teams captain during his senior season. Following his 12th season with the Big Green, McCorkle&rsquo;s name has become synonymous with energy and discipline within the football program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;When we come in, Coach [McCorkle] tells us that he is not going to be our favorite guy over the next four years,&rdquo; former Big Green safety and recent Jacksonville Jaguars identified free agent signee Charlie Miller&rsquo;17 said. &ldquo;He also tells us that he will make us great football players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;McCorkle said his coaching style has a single goal: to make his guys better through perfecting technique. Having played under legendary head coach Steve Spurrier at Florida and as learning from now University of Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops after beginning his coaching career with the Gators, he has had the opportunity to develop under the brightest minds in college football.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I was raised and taught to make sure that everything you do is correct, and that football is a competitive game in which you never want to give opponents an advantage,&rdquo; McCorkle said.</p>
<p>McCorkle noted that he tried to learn as much as he could from all of his coaches and gradually realized the techniques that fit him best on the sidelines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always been a high energy coach and paid attention to the details,&rdquo; McCorkle said. &ldquo;There is just no room for hesitation when you are on the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;At the same time, McCorkle recognizes that his players have different personalities. Making his players better also comes with wearing a doctor&rsquo;s hat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You need to be a psychiatrist because personalities are different,&rdquo; McCorkle said. &ldquo;I know that, while some guys respond immediately after I get on them, others just don&rsquo;t and it&rsquo;s easy to lose them. Adaptability is also everything because some guys need more explanation than others, and it&rsquo;s key to getting the most out of my guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Miller was one such player who responded immediately. He switched to safety from cornerback during spring practice in his sophomore year, and credited McCorkle&rsquo;s coaching as key to Miller&rsquo;s eventual success at his new position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I was discouraged [about] being low on the depth chart at corner, but once I was moved to safety, I realized that I may have the chance to play right away,&rdquo; Miller said. &ldquo;Coach MacCorlkle had high expectations and critiqued everything that I did, but you come to respect that because it makes you better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Despite Miller&rsquo;s success, he admits he had to adjust to McCorkle&rsquo;s fiery demeanor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am a pretty reserved player,&rdquo; Miller said. &ldquo;He would always try to fire me up when he saw that I was more internally inclined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;McCorkle recalled that he believed Miller had all of the tools but was holding back athletically. He viewed holding Miller accountable for calling coverages and defenses at safety as instrumental to helping him build his confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But what stood out most was the fact that Miller was always easy to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Charlie [Miller] was an easy one to coach because he was self-motivated,&rdquo; McCorkle said. &ldquo;I would have to get in front of other guys who would not hustle but never for him. He had all of the natural talent, and when I did have to raise my voice at him, it was only briefly because he would correct himself immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;While McCorkle is loud and intense, he still insists that he is no different than other on-campus figures his players interact with daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as professors set high standards for students, we challenge our players and set the bar high,&rdquo; McCorkle said. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t in the business of holding your hand, but at time we will assist athletes who take has to take ownership and are willing to put in the work to reach their potential.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dallis and McCorkle may mentor their players differently, but in the end, they share the same goal. Their unique coaching styles prove that there is more than one way to awake their athletes&rsquo; potential and help them become the best they can be. After all, that is what matters most.</p>

			<h1> A Cure for Phantom Pain </h1>
			<h3> By: Ali Pattillo </h3>
			<p>It&rsquo;s 5:30 p.m. on an especially warm spring night. Sunlight&rsquo;s last rays cast across Mink Brook. There&rsquo;s a Bernese mountain dog playing fetch with his owner, periodically running head first into the water and shaking his fur across the sandy bank. her students have strung up their orange and purple hammocks on two nearby trees and have spent the past hour pondering both our sense of mortality and the best way to make a Collis breakfast sandwich. I&rsquo;ve just finished a long run through the winding trails that lead to this sun-soaked corner of the Upper Valley. Lungs pounding from the end of my run and sweat pouring over my face, I strip down to my shorts and sports bra and dive into the brook. The shockingly cold feeling is immediate and visceral as my body adjusts to the temperature of the river. I lean my head back and float, feeling the warmth of the first few inches of the water. I see tiny birds darting in and out of clouds ahead. I feel some river weeds wind around my legs. I am buoyant, free from my commitments and suspended from stress.</p>
<p>I am living in a dream. It&rsquo;s a dream I come back to, time and time again. I dreamt of it on my foreign study program in Prague and while sitting in my living room in Atlanta on my off-term. It&rsquo;s the dream I&rsquo;ll carry with me long after I leave this college. I&rsquo;ll carry other dreams of hiking through blazing red leaves in the fall, making homemade pizza at the Dartmouth Organic Farm, dancing on elevated surfaces in basements or taking midnight walks to the golf course. I&rsquo;ll dream of the days I pushed away my work and responsibilities and instead took a drive or walk with friends to paint pottery, visit a farm or go to a diner to eat oversized blueberry muffins. I won&rsquo;t dream of the endless nights I spent pouring over papers, the hours and hours I spent in the periodicals on sunny days or the time I skipped lunch with a friend to print photographs in the darkroom.</p>
<p>No, Dartmouth hasn&rsquo;t always felt like a dream. At times, it&rsquo;s been incredibly difficult &mdash; even nightmarish. At Dartmouth, we rarely talk about the issues we carry, the things which inform our perspectives on the world or hurt us and shape how we treat others and view ourselves. Every student, every human being, carries with them a kind of phantom pain.</p>
<p>Phantom limb syndrome means feeling something that is no longer there and feeling something that you cannot see. When a limb is amputated, the pain doesn&rsquo;t always stop; the feeling of that limb, how it moves, its weight, doesn&rsquo;t just disappear. After it&rsquo;s gone, you can endure unexpected pain with no known cause for months, even years. Phantom pain, similar to phantom limb syndrome, is feeling a gnawing sense of longing, deep in your bones.</p>
<p>For some of us, it&rsquo;s the depression we hide from our roommates, the drug habit we just can&rsquo;t kick, the feeling of exclusion on this overwhelmingly white, wealthy campus, the parent at home who depends on us a bit too much or the crippling sense of self-doubt that we feel might swallow us whole.</p>
<p>My phantom pain is panic. I spent much of my freshman spring term dealing with panic attacks which made my breathing go shallow and paralyzed my body and mind. Growing up and throughout high school, I never felt like the world was closing in on me, until that freshman spring.</p>
<p>Like many other Dartmouth students, I don&rsquo;t often let others see my phantom pain. I exude positivity, even on days when it isn&rsquo;t authentic. Sharing what we carry or showing our weakness would make us soft &mdash; and we are not soft. We are badasses. We are environmental engineers and early-admitted medical school students and Fulbright scholars. We bury this phantom pain over and over, until it starts to feel like it might swallow us whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we alleviate the phantom pain, externally invisible yet omnipresent in our lives?</p>
<p>The only antidote I&rsquo;ve found is to pay attention to the moment.</p>
<p>At dinner the other night, a very wise friend shared a quote by the poet, May Sarton: &ldquo;The quality of life is in proportion, always, to the capacity for delight. The capacity for delight is the gift of paying attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the future is too daunting to imagine and the past too painful to remember, engage in the present.</p>
<p>I would not have survived at Dartmouth without this strategy. By actively practicing it, I&rsquo;ve been able to consistently quell this panic and develop real happiness.</p>
<p>This act of paying attention is what I grab onto when the water rises above my head. Any time panic rises within me like a rustling wildfire, I actively feel the air in my lungs, look up to the sky to explore the curling wisp of a cloud or look down and notice the slight bend of a blade of grass reaching toward the sun. I listen intently to friends, ignoring my phone or my desire to think of my seemingly endless to-do list. I try to lessen their phantom pain and in doing so, alleviate my own. I remind myself that I have a heart that pumps 83 gallons of blood through my body every hour and a brain with neurons that fire 200 times per second. I am alive. I shift my focus back to the present, I exhale and my phantom pain slowly fades.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had moments that change the course of our lives forever, moments which shake us out of normalcy. Maybe it was making a mistake and hurting a person you loved or failing a final exam after a late night out. Or maybe it will be saying goodbye to Dartmouth. Maybe it was the first time you experienced loss or grief or suffering or deep hurt. Maybe it was when you watched classmates lose their chance to be in this world.</p>
<p>These moments remind us that there are no guarantees. We are not promised anything in life. We are not promised the chance to graduate or start our careers or get married or grow old. We are only promised the moment at hand.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of what might be lost. It will be lost. Ultimately, the only relationship we will always have is with ourselves. Everyone we know will eventually die or move away or have six children and no time for weekend ski trips or weeknight drinks. But do not agonize over this reality that you stop living the only life you have. Don&rsquo;t attempt to climb the slippery slope of prediction or prevention of these realities to the point that you lose sight of the beauty and the people in front of you.</p>
<p>Instead, dive headfirst into the universe a moment can hold. Be astonished.</p>
<p>This is how you cure your phantom pain, if only for a moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back at Mink Brook. I&rsquo;m floating in the lazy current of the shallow water. I&rsquo;m disconnected from the world around me, calm and content. I swim back toward the shore, begin to make my way up the bank, sand soft on my feet. I&rsquo;m walking in that familiar dream. I&rsquo;ll wake up soon, but for now, I&rsquo;ll savor the last few ray of sunlight, warm on my skin.</p>

			<h1> Coexist at Dartmouth </h1>
			<h3> By: Alexander Fredman </h3>
			<p>At the beginning of her sophomore summer, Angelina Lionetta &rsquo;18 was worried about one of her upcoming classes. The course, a philosophy class called &ldquo;Reproductive Ethics,&rdquo; would cover subjects such as genetic enhancement, selective diminishment and abortion.</p>
<p>Lionetta is Catholic, and those issues, especially abortion, are sensitive among members of her religion.</p>
<p>Born into what she calls &ldquo;an old Italian family&rdquo; in Andover, Massachussetts, Lionetta grew up as an active member of her church: her parents took her to mass as a baby, she was an altar server and she taught Sunday School for third- through fifth-grade girls. At Dartmouth, Lionetta has continued to be passionate in her religious life, actively participating and organizing social events at Aquinas House, the Catholic student organization on campus.</p>
<p>Lionetta considers herself to be socially liberal, though she leans more conservative on certain issues. She said that as a woman and a pre-med student, she believes that abortion is a public health issue &ndash; one that has implications for both the mother and society. As a Catholic, however, she still maintains that life is sacred. For Lionetta, her beliefs on the subject can be challenging, as they differ from those held by some other devout Catholics.</p>
<p>Coming into her &ldquo;Reproductive Ethics&rdquo; class, Lionetta said she wondered how students in the class would react to her opinions &ndash; would they look down on her for her views? But after having conversations with the professor and engaging in small group discussions with fellow classmates, Lionetta said she realized her concerns were unfounded. In fact, she discovered that the views of her classmates were more diverse than she originally assumed.</p>
<p>Lionetta&rsquo;s experience is not uncommon among religious students at Dartmouth. While students may face apprehension and misunderstanding of their beliefs, overt acts of prejudice are rare. Dartmouth students&rsquo; religious and spiritual experiences are understood best by the nuance used in describing individuals&rsquo; beliefs, rather than by attempting to generalize students into like-minded groups.</p>
<p>For some students, religion and spirituality does not play a prominent role in their Dartmouth experience. A recent poll of students conducted by The Dartmouth found that 43 percent of students identify as either atheist, agnostic or having no religion in particular, and 62 percent of students consider religion as either &ldquo;not too important&rdquo; or &ldquo;not important at all.&rdquo; But truly identifying an individual&rsquo;s sense of spirituality involves more than asking those kinds of questions, Tucker Center dean and chaplain Rabbi Daveen Litwin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think what&rsquo;s true about Dartmouth &hellip; is that while the language of religion is perhaps not, unfortunately, politically correct language these days, the questions that people ask [regarding identification of faith] are using a different kind of a framework,&rdquo; said Litwin, giving the example that the word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; may mean an unquestionable belief in God for one person, but could simply mean a gathering place of family and community for another, she said.</p>
<p>Although religion as a practice may not be the central focus of academic institutions, Litwin believes that Dartmouth is rooted in religious and spiritual traditions. Dartmouth may not like to use the word &ldquo;ritual,&rdquo; she said, but it certainly has many rituals. And these rituals, while not ostensibly religious, often align closely with religious traditions, she said.</p>
<p>As an example, Litwin said, Green Key weekend may not on the surface seem like a religious event. Yet many religions have significant holidays during the spring to celebrate the awakenings of the season. Likewise, Litwin added, Green Key represents an opportunity for Dartmouth students to go outdoors and experience that renewal after enduring a cold, harsh winter.</p>
<p>At the Tucker Center, Litwin oversees 24 recognized religious groups on campus, which encompass all five of the world&rsquo;s major religions. Tucker Center multi-faith advisor Leah Torrey estimates that usually half of the students who participate in such programs identify as atheist or agnostic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often times people think of Tucker as a place for people who are religious, who meet some kind of litmus test around religious life,&rdquo; Torrey said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s really students who are trying to better understand their own sense of ethics, their own sense of values, [and] their own sense of goodness in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of those students is Emily Carter &rsquo;19. Raised in a non-denominational, evangelical Christian household in Washington state, Carter attended private Christian schools through middle school. When she reached high school, however, she said she realized that she did not feel the assurance of salvation that she had expected from her faith, nor did she find her emerging political views to be in line with her religious views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ended up leaving religion because I realized ... it was something I was taught to [believe], not really because I had looked at it objectively and determined that that was what I thought I should [believe],&rdquo; Carter said.</p>
<p>For Carter, coming to Dartmouth was an opportunity to explore her developing value system as an atheist and secular humanist, especially by taking philosophy classes and engaging in programs at the Tucker Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Dartmouth, it seems like people are more open to talking with and being friends with people who have beliefs that are different from theirs,&rdquo; Carter said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s been sort of a good thing for me, to learn to be humble and accept other&rsquo;s beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Torrey said that college is an important time for students to develop their own value systems, especially since they no longer are influenced by their families and home communities on an everyday basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Operating in an independent context takes strength, practice, thought, reflection and prayer,&rdquo; Torrey said. An example of this concept in action is the Interfaith Floor, a living learning community sponsored by the Tucker Center, which brings students together from a diverse range of backgrounds.</p>
<p>Anirudh Udutha &lsquo;18, who is the floor&rsquo;s undergraduate advisor, said that residents write spiritual autobiographies describing their spiritual journeys at Dartmouth as well as participate in alternative worship services. He said that the benefits of these experiences include exposure to a diversity of thought and an open, communal atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather than having something in common ... your commonality is your interest in these questions,&rdquo; Udutha said.</p>
<p>As an Indian-American who grew up in the Atlanta, Georgia area, Udutha knows what it is like to be a member of a religious and ethnic minority. At Dartmouth, Udutha has been an active member of the Hindu community, participating in the student group Shanti and helping plan major events such as the holidays Diwali and Holi.</p>
<p>For Udutha, being Hindu primarily involves the spiritual aspect of the faith, though he does participate in the ritualistic and cultural aspects as well. As a neuroscience major on a pre-med track, Udutha finds that Hinduism represents a way to tie his own sense of spirituality to his beliefs on social justice, community organizing and global health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith is usually tied to the concept of organized religion &ndash; like, a sense of God or something &ndash; and spirituality is a much more internal, personal thing,&rdquo; Udutha said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re connected, but not always the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Udutha said that while Dartmouth has a significant amount of diversity &ndash; even within smaller groups like Shanti &ndash; people still tend to not be as aware of the customs and beliefs of others as they should. Although Udutha said he doesn&rsquo;t find his spiritual beliefs to conflict with what he learns in the classroom, there are occasions in which people with whom he shares his identity as a Hindu have misconceptions about his faith and culture.</p>
<p>For Jacob Casale &rsquo;17, misconceptions about his faith have also been an issue he has faced at Dartmouth. As a former co-president of the Christian Union student group, Casale&rsquo;s faith is a significant part of his life, both before and during his time at Dartmouth. Casale said that often acquaintances are at first not sure how to react when they find this out about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When [my faith] is put on the table as the reality &hellip; people don&rsquo;t necessarily really know what to do with that,&rdquo; Casale said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just kind of like, &lsquo;Oh, well that&rsquo;s nice.&rsquo; And you kind of feel a little bit like an anthropological oddity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Casale added that he sees this issue as a healthy challenge, and that meeting new people with different backgrounds and beliefs gives him the opportunity to constantly develop his own viewpoints.</p>
<p>Growing up in Seattle, Washington, Casale was raised by parents with Methodist upbringings, but never felt tied to one denomination of Christianity. He currently identifies as non-denominational Protestant, and believes that the specific sect of Christianity matter less than the individual&rsquo;s personal relationship to God.</p>
<p>Casale said that being at Dartmouth has forced him to reckon with difficult questions regarding his faith such as the historical veracity and coherence of the Bible, as well as the intersection between faith and scientific reasoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity actually has a rich intellectual history, and has always welcomed intellectual engagement,&rdquo; Casale said. &ldquo;I think the Bible does hold together remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a psychology major and geography minor, Casale admits that there are times when his beliefs do not perfectly align with the academic standard &ndash; for example, he believes that scientific processes and reasoning cannot answer some of the deeper, fundamental questions of life &ndash; but that this process of intellectual engagement with faith is beneficial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can grow as a Christian in the classroom when your beliefs are kind of openly challenged &ndash; or even just in terms of thinking about what you&rsquo;re studying in the lens of your faith,&rdquo; Casale said.</p>

			<h1> Think Dartmouth: Work Hard, Play Hard </h1>
			<h3> By: Chloe Jennings </h3>
			<p>Think Dartmouth: a school in a picturesque college town, charming but remote. A quintessential college campus, with a clock tower, a college green and a set of neatly matched, colonial-style academic buildings. Don&rsquo;t forget frat row&mdash; throw in a hodgepodge of sorority and fraternity houses, a few American flags and a host of Greek letters to which students to pledge their allegiance. You have your setting.</p>
<p>Add a group of high-achieving individuals to the mix. Their academic experience is intense &shy;&mdash; a quarter system with 10 week terms, because who has time for syllabus week? The stakes are high, because they&rsquo;ve worked hard to get into the school and they need to work even harder if they want that J.P. Morgan internship. But also remember that these students are social beings, so they&rsquo;re not just occupied with studying. Think back to frat row. Students take a break from their econ finals, Spanish papers and history theses to blow off some steam on the weekends. There&rsquo;s a deep reverence for the game of pong, an ongoing series of fraternity parties and a termly &ldquo;big weekend.&rdquo; With few off-campus social spaces, it is pretty much expected that one can step into a fraternity basement to check out what these students are up to &mdash; and to see whether the intensity of their partying matches the intensity of their study habits.</p>
<p>When you look at Dartmouth this way, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the College is subject to stereotypes. Given the all-encompassing nature of Dartmouth &mdash; rigorous academics, a social scene that revolves around on campus Greek houses and a location that amplifies our commitment to both &mdash; it makes sense that the school has a reputation of having a &ldquo;work hard, play hard&rdquo; mentality. The fact that Dartmouth is both generalizable and unique, like a smaller, more intense version of a standard depiction of college, makes it an easy target for stereotypes.</p>
<p>Andrew Lohse&rsquo;s&rsquo;12 &ldquo;Confessions of An Ivy League Frat Boy&rdquo; paints a picture of the school as being little more than a playground for future Goldman executives &mdash; a place where preppy frat brothers ace econ midterms by day and morph into beer-guzzling animals by night and a place with Greek houses in which the future corporate leaders of America shake hands over games of pong and exchange stories of their sexual conquests. Dartmouth has been touted as epitomizing the downfalls of the Greek system and a nationwide epidemic of binge drinking and excessive partying. Add that to its Ivy League status, and you get denunciations of privilege and a condemnation of the &ldquo;Dartmouth mentality&rdquo; that keeps students studying hard and partying harder with little regard for the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>To what extent are the stereotypes that surround life at Dartmouth true? I talked to a few students to gauge whether this &ldquo;work hard, play hard&rdquo; reputation is accurate, and to see how individual students might find balance in a culture where social and academic pressures can be high.</p>
<p>Isabel Taben&rsquo;19 is an affiliated student athlete at Dartmouth &mdash; which means that she has to find time to balance lacrosse, clubs, her sorority and her social life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, you have to sacrifice something, and lacrosse and school always come first,&rdquo; Taben said. &ldquo;But one of the things I like about being an athlete here is the flexibility that I have. Other schools pick classes for athletes, but I can major in whatever I want or even take a class when I have practice if I absolutely need to,&rdquo;</p>
<p>People from other schools are often surprised to find that Taben is an athlete in a sorority, she said. However, she said that her time with her sorority is flexible and that students at a school like Dartmouth understand that everyone has other commitments.</p>
<p>Taben said that striking the right balance can be difficult and that it&rsquo;s taken her most of her two years here to figure out how to effectively manage her time. For her, the fast-paced nature of the quarter system makes it particularly challenging to juggle athletics and academics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed five days of classes for lacrosse,&rdquo; said Taben. &ldquo;When you only have 10 weeks in a term, if you miss a day, it&rsquo;s a big deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite her various commitments, Taben affirmed that she finds time to socialize on the weekends. According to Taben, this is typical of Dartmouth students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say that Dartmouth has a work-hard, play-hard attitude, to some extent,&rdquo; Taben said. &ldquo;But I think that&rsquo;s a good thing, because people are really focused on getting their work done but they get a break to go out on the weekends with their friends and just have fun ... it&rsquo;s hard to do work all the time if you never get a break from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah Kovan &rsquo;19 agreed that students do like to study and socialize but argued that the reputation is in part inaccurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that Dartmouth students actually party more than students at other schools,&rdquo; Kovan said. &ldquo;I think that Dartmouth has the reputation of being a party school because most of the partying that goes on is confined to the campus. At schools in less rural areas, students can go to bars and clubs in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alternatively, Alex Chao &rsquo;20 explained that he was attracted to Dartmouth&rsquo;s reputation when applying to college because, for him, it meant that Dartmouth provided academic and social opportunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students at Dartmouth deeply value their academic experience, but they equally embrace the opportunity to participate in a vibrant social life,&rdquo; Chao said.</p>
<p>For Chao, balancing work and play means maximizing his productivity during free time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my experience, balancing your social life and work means that you have to use the chunks of free time you do have efficiently,&rdquo; Chao said.</p>
<p>I also spoke with sociology professor Janice McCabe, who studies the interaction between college friendships and academic success, to get a sense of what Dartmouth&rsquo;s academic and social culture might look like from a sociological perspective.</p>
<p>McCabe recently published a book, &ldquo;Connecting in College: How Friendship Networks Matter for Academic and Social Success,&rdquo; in which she examined college students&rsquo; friendship networks. McCabe interviewed students at a large public Midwestern university, which she refers to as MU in her book. McCabe asked students to rate themselves on a scale from academic to social. Most of the students at MU rated themselves exactly in the middle (a score of 5), and three-quarters of the students rated themselves between 4 and 6. McCabe then compared these responses to the responses of Dartmouth students and found that the responses that she received from Dartmouth students were relatively similar to the responses she received from the MU students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you just look at the average, the interviews I&rsquo;ve been doing with Dartmouth students are quite similar, but there&rsquo;s also more of a range,&rdquo; McCabe said. &ldquo;So the idea of balance seems to resonate really well with students here, but it seems like there are more students who see themselves as being more academic than typical. They feel like that&rsquo;s a good balance for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCabe said that the academic rigor of Dartmouth may play a role in students&rsquo; ratings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think when Dartmouth students are putting themselves in the middle, oftentimes academics is more objectively higher, but perhaps their social life is too,&rdquo; McCabe said. &ldquo;I hear a lot of that &lsquo;work hard, play hard&rsquo; idea here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCabe explained that, though students strive to balance their academic and social lives here at Dartmouth, few reported that their social lives were detrimental to their academic performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were times when students would tell me that their academics suffered because of social life, but it seems like those were more the exceptions,&rdquo; McCabe said. &ldquo;In general, people strategize to put academics first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems unrealistic to assume that Dartmouth&rsquo;s culture varies drastically from its Ivy League counterparts or from other schools across the country. It&rsquo;s easy to criticize Dartmouth, not only because the school is so classically &ldquo;college,&rdquo; but also because the extremely campus-focused nature of Dartmouth makes any issues that exist at Dartmouth particularly visible. However, Dartmouth students&mdash;like any college students&mdash; seem more focused on finding balance between work and play than pursuing extremes on either end. Of course, Dartmouth&rsquo;s &ldquo;work hard, play hard&rdquo; reputation is not unfounded in that the College is a top academic institution with one of the highest levels of Greek affiliation in the country. In this way, the negative press that Dartmouth has received in recent years has been effective in drawing attention to issues that can accompany privilege, Greek life and an epidemic of binge drinking. However, while criticisms are valid and may indeed be amplified by the specific conditions at Dartmouth, they represent issues that exist across universities and Greek systems nationwide. They certainly should not be isolated to Dartmouth alone. It is also important to remember that Lohse&rsquo;s portrait of Dartmouth &mdash; and the negative media attention that it sparked &mdash; caricaturizes Dartmouth students and ignores the diversity that exists within the student body. The portrait of the Dartmouth student as corporate-obsessed, diligent library goer by day and hard-partying frat brother by night is as dramatic as it is overly simplistic.</p>

			<h1> Faculty and Staff Evaluate the Community at Dartmouth </h1>
			<h3> By: Julian Nathan </h3>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth’s commitment to fostering a supportive community is highlighted
			    prominently on the College’s website and in its marketing materials.
			    However, faculty and staff at the College have differing opinions on
			    whether Dartmouth has succeeded in its efforts to create the inclusive
			    community it promotes and publicizes. Some of the new changes implemented
			    by the Moving Dartmouth Forward initiative, such as the house communities
			    and an increased focus on academic rigor, seem to be having an effect on
			    the sense of community felt on campus.
			</p>
			<img src="images/house communities 1 by Paula Kutschera.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Peter Marsh of facilities, operations &amp; management, who has spent over
			    30 years working at Dartmouth and is a former trustee for Dartmouth’s
			    branch of the Service Employees International Union, said that he has
			    observed some negative changes in Dartmouth’s community atmosphere over the
			    years.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh explained that students seem to be more academically stressed than
			    ever before. He added that students’ increased focus on academics might
			    have come at the expense of long-standing Dartmouth traditions. Among the
			    traditions he said that Dartmouth has lost is the construction of snow
			    sculptures during Winter Carnival.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh, who grew up in Hanover, recounted a time decades ago when students
			    built snow sculptures “everywhere.” He added that now, it seems that
			    students are too busy to build any snow sculptures at all. On Jan. 13, a
			    campus-wide email announcement from the Winter Carnival Council explained
			    that “many years of declining involvement from the student body” led the
			    Council to focus its efforts on other Winter Carnival events. The Council
			    also listed decreasing snowfall and an absence of student leadership as
			    reasons for its decision.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh remarked that over the years, campus-wide enthusiasm about events
			    like Homecoming seems to have gradually decreased.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The loss of these traditions could be tied to a larger change in
			    Dartmouth’s community atmosphere as a whole, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh also said that, in the last decade, a strain of elitism has pervaded
			    campus. He said that this elitism was not entirely contained within the
			    student body. On some occasions, Marsh said he has felt as though Dartmouth
			    community members have treated him as “the help.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He also said that over the years, political correctness has stifled free
			    speech and open discussion on campus. According to Marsh, students used to
			    be more receptive towards more conservative publications like The Dartmouth
			    Review.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Students do not want to read anything that they do not agree with, he
			    added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Still, on the whole, community at Dartmouth is more of a positive factor
			    than a negative one, Marsh said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Physics professor Ryan Hickox, who is also West House’s house professor,
			    said he has not noticed any negative trends in student behavior towards
			    each other, faculty and staff during the six years he has worked at the
			    College. While there are some isolated instances where students are
			    disrespectful towards others, these incidents appear to have become less
			    common throughout his time at Dartmouth, he added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dartmouth Dining Services supervisor Gordon Wright said that he has not
			    noticed any trends related to elitism or increased academic stress on
			    campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He characterized all of the interactions that he has had with students
			    during his seven-year tenure at DDS as positive, noting that he becomes
			    especially familiar with athletic teams that frequent the Class of 1953
			    Commons.
			</p>

			<p>
			    He added that most of the interactions he has witnessed occurring between
			    students have been positive.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hickox said that house communities might further strengthen the College’s
			    campus community as future classes become more involved in the programming.
			    He said that house communities could facilitate “genuine interactions among
			    diverse groups of people.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    House communities also facilitate interactions between faculty members who
			    might otherwise not have ever crossed paths, he said.
			</p>
			<img src="images/house communities 2 by Paula Kutschera.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    “Our house communities provide an opportunity for faculty members in
			    different departments to get together in a purely social environment,”
			    Hickox added.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Wright also said that DDS’ policy of providing faculty members with
			    discounted prices, as well as the Paganucci Lounge, which provides faculty
			    with a space to dine with colleagues, have attracted more faculty to eat at
			    ’53 Commons. The increasing presence of College faculty at the dining hall
			    has allowed him to become familiar with faculty members he might not have
			    otherwise encountered, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Marsh, however, said that the College has felt increasingly impersonal and
			    corporate, adding that Dartmouth’s previously-existing personal culture set
			    it apart from other universities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Hickox said that he has not observed any degradation in the College’s
			    ideals of civility, respect, empathy and rigor in his time at the College.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Most of the things that I see happening on campus give me a very positive
			    sense of where the community is going,” he said. “The vast majority of the
			    interactions that I see [occurring between students] are really positive.”

			<h1> Senior Varsity Co-Captains Reflect On Close Team Bonds </h1>
			<h3> By: Nathan Albrinck </h3>
			<img src="images/football by Hollye Swinehart.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Dartmouth’s athletic programs aren’t as flashy as Duke University
			    basketball or Ohio State University football, but to those undergraduates
			    at the College who are varsity athletes, their teams are just as important
			    as the teams playing high-profile games on national television.
			</p>
			<p>
			    For football co-captain Folarin Orimolade ’17, playing at Dartmouth changed
			    his “life for the better.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It was an amazing feeling to be a part of such an amazing institution with
			    a storied tradition,” Orimolade said. “The team in particular has meant so
			    much to me.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Like many members of the team, Orimolade has invested countless hours into
			    the football program, resulting in the formation of a strong bond among
			    members.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “When you’re so focused on the goal of winning a game and the preparation
			    for that, and you’re spending all this time working out with each other,
			    watching film with each other, fighting with each other, it makes for a
			    close-knit bond that can’t be broken by anything,” Orimolade said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In addition to mandatory practice and film sessions, the football team eats
			    together almost every day, in and out of season. With all their shared
			    time, on and off the field, Orimolade’s teams have compiled an impressive
			    27-13 four-year record. The senior himself finished his career second
			    all-time in sacks for the Big Green with 23.5 and was the 2016 Ivy League
			    Defensive Player of the Year.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Similarly, James Hickok ’17, the goalkeeper and captain for the men’s
			    soccer team, experienced success on the field and noted how close he is to
			    his teammates. Hickok considers the seven seniors on the soccer team to be
			    his closest friends, and he currently lives with five of them.
			</p>
			<p>
			    This past fall, Hickok helped lead Dartmouth to the second round of the
			    NCAA tournament. His seven shutouts during his senior season are tied for
			    fourth most in a single season in Dartmouth soccer history.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While there are many positives to participating in varsity athletics,
			    working as both a student and an athlete simultaneously is not easy. For
			    Orimolade and Hickok, the commitment is unyielding.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “[The season] consumes your mental capacity, more than even your time,
			    because you have games coming up, and you’re always worried about your
			    performance,” Hickok said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Even on top of their already busy schedules, many student-athletes choose
			    to participate in various extracurricular and volunteer activities. Hickok
			    knows teammates involved in all sorts of off-field activities, from band
			    and the arts to mentorship programs off-campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We try to do our best as a team to get involved in fundraisers and events
			    that [the athletic department] throws,” Hickok said. “You don’t have time
			    like you do out of season to do things like skiing though. In season,
			    soccer is a focus almost around the clock.”
			</p>
			<img src="images/Floren 2 by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    Orimolade, who has taken four classes in each of his last three terms,
			    knows the struggle of balancing athletics and academics as well as anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Your time is essentially gone from two to eight o’clock, and you have
			    class before that,” Orimolade said. “It’s a struggle to find time
			    sometimes. You always make time for whatever’s important to you though.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Midway through his seventh season with the school, athletic director Harry
			    Sheehy prides the athletic department on its continued commitment to
			    academics.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “The experience academically comes first,” Sheehy said. “We talk about a
			    balance between academics and athletics, but I think academics should be
			    the heavier weight. Our students have chosen to come here to a Division I
			    Ivy League program so obviously the demands are significant. Learning to
			    balance those things and to make good decisions is all part of growing up.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Through programs like Dartmouth Peak Performance, Sheehy and the athletic
			    department incorporate academics into their athletic sphere. Dartmouth has
			    led Division I programs in six-year graduation rate in four of the last
			    five years and has led Division I programs in Academic Progress Rate in
			    each of the last four. The Academic Progress Rate rates NCAA varsity teams
			    on a scale from one to 1000, and is a measure of athletes’ academic
			    performance and retention.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “What we do in athletics is not academic in nature, but it is certainly
			    educational in nature,” Sheehy said. “I look at these 35 varsity teams and
			    our club programs as learning laboratories to help the young folks mature
			    and gain confidence and strength to be able to perform at their highest
			    level. We’re trying to bring assets to bear that will enable our athletes
			    to have great success on the field and off the field.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Sheehy fosters the connection between the athletic administration and the
			    teams he overlooks by getting out of his office as much as he can and
			    working with the teams directly. He visits every team captain to talk about
			    goals and challenges before the season gets underway. In addition to
			    continued contact with coaches, he regularly speaks to entire Dartmouth
			    teams. For Sheehy, there is no disconnect between coaches, professors,
			    students, athletes and administrators at Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    He sees the athletic programs as important in unifying the Dartmouth
			    community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “No one feels the same way about anything of importance, but if we’re
			    playing Harvard [University] in Homecoming football, for three hours
			    virtually the whole stadium feels the same way,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Especially at a college with an immensely diverse range of viewpoints,
			    athletics are in a unique position to rally the student body behind a
			    single cause. Just ask any of the hundreds of students who waited in line
			    outside Thompson Arena for the hockey game against Princeton University.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “We bring the community on board with us as we try to have success,” Sheehy
			    said.

			<h1> Faculty Attracted to the Teaching Atmosphere at the College </h1>
			<h3> By: Marie-Capucine Pineau-Valencienne </h3>
			<p>
			    When we think of “Dartmouth,” we think of our friends, our scenic campus
			    and of course, our professors — but do the faculty at the College also feel
			    a unique sense of community? One of the most defining elements of a
			    “Dartmouth education” is learning what the word “community” really means.
			    At Dartmouth our sense of community sets our experience apart from others
			    and what, ironically, binds us all together. There is a reason why
			    Dartmouth has one of the most loyal and far-reaching alumni networks.
			    There’s a reason why alumni and families religiously flood into Hanover
			    every Homecoming weekend. And there’s a reason why the student body as a
			    whole is seemingly clothed in one particular shade of green. That reason?
			    Community.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Faculty Lounge by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    The concept of “Dartmouth” is much more than a charming New England Ivy
			    League institution. It’s much more than the pretty facade of Dartmouth Hall
			    or the echo of the clock in Baker Tower. The Dartmouth we know and love is
			    composed of the people who populate and give life to our seemingly idyllic
			    campus. Our vigorous sense of community is a reflection of not only the
			    dynamic student body but also the faculty who captain our big green ship.
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to history professor Edward Miller, who has taught at the College
			    for 13 years, there is in fact “a very strong community among the faculty
			    at Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    As I spoke to different professors about why they decided to stay at
			    Dartmouth, I quickly realized that our hybrid identity as both an
			    undergraduate college and a top-tier research university was one of the
			    most attractive aspects to many of the long-residing faculty.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Dartmouth is the only school I know of that really tries to split the
			    difference, that really emphasizes that they want their faculty to be both
			    excellent teachers and cutting edge outstanding researchers,” Miller said.
			    “And so for me that’s the most distinctive thing about Dartmouth.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    According to Miller, another benefit of teaching at Dartmouth is the size
			    of the faculty community. He said that the College has a large enough
			    faculty group to introduce diversity, though it is not as big as other
			    high-level research universities.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “At some of these large research universities you can spend your whole
			    career there and never get to know people in many other departments because
			    the community is just too big,” Miller said. “Here at Dartmouth, if you
			    stay here long enough you will meet most of your colleagues, even in other
			    departments and other divisions.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Miller added that he likes that his “primary home,” the history department,
			    is medium-sized, because it allows faculty in the department to specialize
			    in their teaching.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Faculty Lounge 2 by Saphfire Brown.jpg" width = "550" height = "380" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    “You can teach courses on the area of your research specialty,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Dean of the faculty of arts and sciences and government professor Michael
			    Mastanduno, who has been a faculty member at the College for over 30 years,
			    echoed Miller’s sentiments on Dartmouth’s “rare” balance between teaching
			    and research.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Dartmouth is a place where it really brings the two together, and it gives
			    faculty members time and resources to be leading scholars but also creates
			    a culture where the undergraduate experience is a top priority,” Mastanduno
			    said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Mastanduno said he observed how many of the faculty “really engage in the
			    culture here.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    “It’s a small community, but it’s also cultural,” he said. “There’s a sense
			    here, for example, that faculty members feel they should participate in the
			    governance of the school.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Mastanduno added that faculty are involved in the College community through
			    their engagement in its governance. Faculty care about their colleagues and
			    the success of the institution, he said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Even those who never envisioned a career in academia have found a home at
			    Dartmouth. After working on economic policy in Washington, D.C. and
			    Chicago, Illinois, economics professor Douglas Irwin said he knew that he
			    wanted to pursue a career in academia, but for his wife, fellow economics
			    professor Marjorie Rose, the feeling was not exactly mutual. The couple,
			    who have been staples of the Dartmouth economics department for 19 years,
			    explained how slowly but surely, Rose came to adopt Dartmouth as a new home
			    for their family.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the process of acclimating to her new career path after leaving her job
			    at the International Monetary Fund in D.C., Rose said she discovered a love
			    for teaching she never knew she had before.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I just love teaching Dartmouth students,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Rose and Irwin described that being both a couple and professors in the
			    same department has ultimately allowed them to become better educators.
			    They explained how they are able to lean on each other and ask, “What are
			    the things that are interesting to our students?”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Irwin and Rose said they found a community at the College through their
			    relationship with their students. For nine years now the couple said they
			    have hosted “senior women dinners” at their home. They added that
			    conversations during one of these student dinners was the “impetus for the
			    Political Economy Project,” a program directed by Irwin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Similarly, Miller and Mastanduno also said their students were an important
			    reason that they were inclined to engage in the Dartmouth community.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “I really do think that the students are the best thing about Dartmouth,”
			    Miller said. “I think that as a group, you will not find a group of
			    undergraduates who are more committed to learning for learning’s sake.”

			<h1> Through the Looking Glass: Dartmouth's Mythical Community </h1>
			<h3> By: Emily Burack </h3>
			<p>
			    Winters at Dartmouth are my favorite terms. Winters in general are my
			    favorite time — there is something magical in the beginning of the year,
			    the promise of something new and the hope for many snow days. I have been
			    on campus every winter, and I have come to appreciate this hated term for
			    slightly shorter lines at the Collis Center and a general acceptance of not
			    going out on Friday nights. I have also come to appreciate how much my
			    winters here have taught me about Dartmouth’s mythical community.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Emily Burack courtesy.jpg" align = "left" hspace = "50" vspace = "50">
			<p>
			    I say “mythical” because I’m not sure Dartmouth’s community really exists.
			    Dartmouth’s community is advertised as this passionate, loving,
			    all-consuming entity in which first-years feel welcomed from the moment
			    they step onto Robo lawn during Trips. While that welcoming spirit is
			    undeniably present at many moments, Dartmouth’s community feels fractured
			    to me.
			</p>
			<p>
			    My first winter, I learned how much I could hate Dartmouth. I was not
			    taking hard classes, and it was snowing a lot, which should both be
			    positive things, but I was floundering in search for something that could
			    be mine and a place where I could feel at home. Memories of fall of my
			    first year feel hazy and overwhelming. Nothing stuck from that fall besides
			    my academics (taking History 24, “The Cold War &amp; American Life,” was
			    the best decision I have made in my time here — that professor is now my
			    thesis advisor). That failure to find solid ground in the fall — I joined
			    no clubs and became a member of no groups — translated to feeling lost in
			    this supposedly close community. I learned a lot that winter about the
			    worst in people; simultaneously, I realized how much I longed to find a
			    community within Dartmouth, because “Dartmouth” as a community just was not
			    enough. Being a Dartmouth student gives you a sense of camaraderie, not
			    necessarily a supportive community. Whether or not communities, by default,
			    must be supportive is a question for another day. But in my imagination, in
			    a community, people actively care for one another. That winter, I didn’t
			    feel cared for.
			</p>
			<p>
			    My second winter, I began to find spaces that cared for me. Beginning to
			    work out what I had valued over my first year and a half, I realized the
			    communities I valued were exclusively female. In the female-dominated
			    social spaces and the group chats that were never silent, I began to build
			    my community out of the women here. That same winter, I took Religion 20.2,
			    “Magic, Science &amp; Religion,” hoping to learn about magical worlds (we
			    did not). That term I learned the magical world was not some alternate
			    universe but finding magic in the mundane of Dartmouth: in the pleasures of
			    sending music to friends, in the dependency of a weekly lunch date, in
			    teaching skiing and in beginning to find my voice about how I felt toward
			    Dartmouth. I started writing more; I remember best a piece for Mouth
			    entitled, “How are you?” about how fake our daily interactions here are and
			    an anonymous submission to Voices that winter. At Voices, when a girl
			    walked out onto the stage and began telling my story, tears started
			    streaming down my face. My friends enveloped me in hugs and held me and
			    reassured me that my story was important and I didn’t sound stupid. These
			    women caring for me reminded me that I had found my own little community
			    here at Dartmouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			    My third winter, I found joy in Dartmouth. Not for the first time, but for
			    the most sustained time. I wasn’t taking classes, and the issues that
			    typically characterize my terms here – insurmountable workloads and stress
			    – faded away into research I enjoyed, wintery adventures that let me
			    explore the beauty of the Upper Valley and dedicated viewings of “Jane the
			    Virgin.” Happiness is so fleeting here; one moment, I can feel so happy and
			    so content, thinking, “Wow, I love this place,” and the next, I feel so
			    dejected and drained that I don’t know how I have ever enjoyed school. But
			    that winter, that third winter, reminded me of all the love that exists in
			    my life because of Dartmouth. All the magic of music blitzes and yummy
			    sandwiches on sourdough bread and drinking good beer with good friends.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Now, during my final winter, I am struggling to reconcile the moments of
			    magic in this place and this community with the moments where I feel as
			    lost as I did that first winter. I try to understand how a place that has
			    brought me my closest friends and helped me uncover my academic passions
			    has also been extraordinarily challenging and draining. I am trying to help
			    spaces and communities I belong to and care deeply about become more
			    inclusive. But I struggle with how communities premised on exclusivity,
			    like Dartmouth itself, can ever be considered inclusive. I am frustrated by
			    the failures of our community, from the small to the large, and the current
			    inability of Dartmouth to make every student on this campus feel supported
			    and protected. I am frustrated by the trust that should be there in a
			    hookup that is not, by the lack of support for the most marginalized
			    students here and by the notion that one Dartmouth community fits all.
			</p>
			<p>
			    During the winter, Dartmouth is the best, even though it can sometimes be
			    the worst. It reminds me that I love snow days more than anything. It
			    reminds me that not everyone can understand Dartmouth’s community the way I
			    do, and I can’t understand it as my peers do. Everyone at this school has
			    competing views of Dartmouth, not only as the school ought to be but as it
			    exists. Trying to reconcile these divergent views of a place we all share
			    to form one opinion on Dartmouth’s community is just not possible. But I
			    know this: I would take my friendships, the women who have made this place
			    meaningful and magical, over this large and mythical community any day.

			<h1> The Places We Make </h1>
			<h3> By: Matthew Brown </h3>
			<p>
			    There is a lot to the name “Dartmouth.” The Dartmouth of today bears almost
			    no resemblance to the College on the Hill that Eleazar Wheelock founded in
			    1769. The school itself has grown to become one of the wealthiest and most
			    storied universities in the country, with a brand that has swelled in
			    tandem. The student body is larger, multi-ethnic, multi-national,
			    gender-inclusive and home to many amazing minds and talents. These are all
			    expected markers of the 21st century university, but reflecting on how
			    drastically Dartmouth has evolved over the years demonstrates that this
			    place is made up by those who inhabit it. The name “Dartmouth” is defined
			    by its community; everything that the name connotes is the product of our
			    shared actions. That also means that people’s perception of this place will
			    vary depending on what part of the community they have come to know. You
			    learn that just by wandering around campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the same time as crowds hop up and down Webster Avenue, there are
			    theatrical works being put on at the Hopkins Center for the Art, and spoken
			    word performed in One Wheelock. Groundbreaking research and last-minute
			    problem sets are completed while a student band plays to a packed crowd. On
			    any given day, there are club events, Greek life activities, nature
			    outings, art shows, socials and sporting events of every level for campus
			    to engage in. We pride ourselves on our involvements and interests so much
			    that we affiliate them with our identities at Dartmouth. For all this
			    supposed diversity of identity and involvement, I consistently feel as if
			    the school is not as interconnected as it should be. Those same communities
			    we find silo too many of us away from the greater community, leading to
			    wildly divergent experiences depending on who you surround yourself with.
			    In a time when understanding those who are not like us has become
			    paramount, I’m concerned that even at our small liberal arts college we
			    still find ways to insulate ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Discussions on how to build functioning diverse communities shouldn’t be
			    new to Dartmouth students. The debates that embroil campus usually focus on
			    how large, quantifiable groups fit into campus. The Greek system has long
			    been the central pillar of community at Dartmouth, though campus has also
			    debated how to build more inclusive clubs, sports teams, performance groups
			    and social scenes. A central goal of College President Phil Hanlon’s Moving
			    Dartmouth Forward initiative is premised on the idea that you can build
			    community through organizations and social engineering. This is a fair
			    approach, as similar people tend to gravitate toward each other. What’s
			    often overlooked in these talks, however, is the very personal and
			    individualized nature of community building. Community is, after all, just
			    people en masse, united by common bonds. If we as a Dartmouth community are
			    serious about bridging interest, race, wealth and lifestyle divides, then
			    we must be willing to communicate outside of our familiar spaces.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Healthy community building occurs on the individual level. It’s all too
			    natural for us to reduce each other to some demographic or group
			    membership. We don’t make it easier for ourselves when we literally wear
			    our affiliations on our sleeve, whether it be some club, sport, Greek house
			    or housing community. It is a mistake, however, to look at any group as a
			    monolith. Even the most homogenized group is still made up of individuals,
			    all of whom have a unique combination of identities and lived experiences.
			    Humanizing others and coming to respect and accept their differing
			    identities is the first step to creating the bonds that we desire. It is
			    easy to understand and communicate with someone who shares your interests,
			    but it becomes difficult and potentially challenging when differences are
			    more apparent. However, you do not need to be identical to another person
			    to have camaraderie. If we want to build a stronger, more connected campus,
			    then we must take the time to learn about and interact with each other as
			    individuals. Rome wasn’t built in a day — and neither was its culture and
			    identity.
			</p>
			<p>
			    All of this requires that we be fearless in action. In context, it’s a bit
			    strange to call venturing into some party, club or event you’ve never been
			    to before a brave act, but confidence and good faith are often requisite
			    when entering unfamiliar spaces. This principle is key to building
			    community on campus and in society at large. The Balkanization of the
			    Friday night social scene is inevitable, but such differences in expression
			    should never bar us from interacting or sharing in spaces with which we are
			    connected. Dartmouth will always mean many different things to different
			    people, but as students it is necessary to appreciate the fact that there
			    is no one way to “do Dartmouth” and that all communities on this campus,
			    and the school itself, are ours to shape, not the other way around. We
			    should also take the opportunity to learn from the exceptional and diverse
			    student body that is assembled here, as in all likelihood this is the last
			    time that most of us will be surrounded by those unlike us. We owe it to
			    each other to at least acknowledge and respect our classmates as individual
			    people, even if we occupy divergent worlds. This is not a recipe for social
			    harmony, but any step toward a closer-knit campus must start with the
			    one-on-one.

			<h1> Expanding the Bubble </h1>
			<h3> By: Hansa Sharma </h3>
			<p>
			    Communité is the Anglo-French word that gave rise to our English word
			    “community.” Communité signified commonness, everybody — inspiring a warm,
			    fuzzy feeling of wholesomeness. “Community” is one of the first words that
			    came to mind when I first visited Dartmouth during Homecoming in fall of
			    2013. Basking in the glorious peak foliage of New England autumn, I saw
			    alumni — proudly flaunting sweaters from class years way before either of
			    my parents’ birth years — interacting with the eager, albeit nervous,
			    members of the Class of 2017 getting ready to take part in the “cultish”
			    tradition of running around the spectacular bonfire as the newest members
			    of the Dartmouth collective. My decision was made. I decided to apply to
			    Dartmouth right then and there.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Now in my fifth term at Dartmouth, my definition — and definitely the
			    College’s definition — of community has taken quite a few turns. Under the
			    all-encompassing shadow of the Moving Dartmouth Forward initiative, the
			    Dartmouth community has seen highs and lows, unifying solidarity and
			    strained tensions. These changes have been openly embraced by some parts of
			    the campus population and loudly protested by others. But amidst all this
			    change, one trait has remained constant: Dartmouth’s openness to engage in
			    dialogue and voice dissenting opinions. Whether it is inside classroom
			    walls discussing current events or in public spaces, our communal spirit
			    extends to the macro level. And after the strong reactions that the recent
			    presidential election and its fallout have elicited, our conception of the
			    Dartmouth community is drastically changing and expanding.
			</p>
			<p>
			    “Community” is the free space where students and veteran groups from across
			    the Upper Valley can openly protest and express dissenting views. Community
			    is fostered through the respect that it takes to step outside of your
			    comfort zone and listen to a story markedly different from yours. After
			    all, inclusion begins with communication. Our campus has been very
			    receptive to initiating dialogues that, at times, may involve uncomfortable
			    and sensitive issues but ultimately lend themselves to a robust worldview.
			    In this time of change, it is important to be cognizant of our attempts at
			    inclusion so that we do not unintentionally create exclusionary practices.
			</p>
			<p>
			    After the inauguration, 3.3 million people participated in a Women’s March
			    against the policies of President Donald Trump throughout the country,
			    including several groups of Dartmouth students and alumnae. These events
			    featured speeches from public figures across the political spectrum and
			    galvanized many to stand up for their rights and their fellow citizens’
			    rights, under threat now more than ever.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The Women’s March is a shining example of our most essential and innate
			    constitutional right as American citizens: the right to assemble and
			    protest. That right has fueled the birth and growth of the country we all
			    lovingly call our own: the United States of America.
			</p>
			<p>
			    But despite this apparent unity, divisions remain. Not all women agree
			    about Trump and his policies. In achieving victory, he carried the votes of
			    42 percent of women — including 53 percent of white women. Many have
			    discussed the marginalization of working-class white voters in the Rust
			    Belt and their dissatisfaction with former Democratic presidential
			    candidate Hillary Clinton, perceived as one of the key factors that
			    propelled Trump to his victory in key states like Ohio and Wisconsin.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While it is true that many of the policy measures Trump hopes to enact are
			    particularly threatening to women and minority groups, the direct sexism
			    that many protesters see in Trump and his team should not breed indirect
			    sexism in retaliation. This holds true for our Dartmouth community as well.
			    In these politically tumultuous times, it is important to reinforce our
			    values of openness to all opinions in an academic and intellectually
			    stimulating environment. In the microcosm of our College on the Hill, it is
			    easy to trap ourselves in a bubble. But we have to remain mindful of the
			    fact that our community consists of not only the student population but
			    also the communities in the Upper Valley region that have ensured the
			    success of the College from 1769 to the present day. And of course we are
			    also a part of a national community. Let’s hope that inclusion doesn’t end
			    up excluding.

			<h1> See the Forster Through the Trees </h1>
			<h3> By: William Sandlund </h3>
			<p>
			    When I visited a friend in Berkeley, California, I noticed something odd as
			    we sat on a café bench still damp from the rain. Blocking my view of the
			    road were seven battered and disused newspaper vending machines. I pointed
			    them out to my friend, and he remarked sullenly, “Don’t make me look at
			    them any longer; it’s too depressing.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    He had a point. There was something sad and even surreal about those clunky
			    objects that no longer served a purpose. They were forgotten ­— literally
			    left by the wayside. I had needed five minutes just to register their total
			    lack of presence. It was strange to be confronted by a labor-saving device
			    that itself had become obsolete and stranger still to feel emotional about
			    it.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Newspaper vending machines are distant memories for my generation, like a
			    well-loved relative who died in our infant days. I vaguely recall seeing
			    one of these contraptions as a child and being utterly confused even then.
			    I asked my dad, “Why don’t people just take all the newspapers?” He said
			    something about honesty and how most people only need one copy. From my
			    now-jaded perspective, I can understand that it was probably cheaper to
			    have the newspaper vending machine than to pay someone to hawk papers, just
			    as it is now more cost-effective to abandon the device on roadsides across
			    the country than to dispose of them.
			</p>
			<p>
			    While it is sad to behold forgotten times in their rusted forms, there is
			    some comfort in the sentimental caress of history. The push and pull of
			    technological development and obsolescence, guided by market forces, is a
			    permanent fixture in our lives. Even when our good nature is exploited for
			    profit by an object as simple as a newspaper vending machine, you can’t
			    help but admire the simple act of taking just one copy off the top of the
			    stack.
			</p>
			<p>
			    English novelist E.M. Forster saw such common decency as the essence and
			    grace of the human race. In his resonant essay “What I Believe,” published
			    on the eve of World War II, Forster wrote: “The man who is selling
			    newspapers outside the Houses of Parliament can safely leave his papers to
			    go for a drink, and his cap beside them: anyone who takes a paper is sure
			    to drop a copper into the cap. But the men who are inside the Houses of
			    Parliament — they can’t trust one another like that; still less can the
			    government they compose trust other governments.”
			</p>
			<p>
			    Forster understood that there is a fundamental understanding in our
			    immediate human interactions that forms the foundation of a peaceful
			    society. He identified a certain type of person who moved through life
			    exuding an essential morality. But this aspect of human nature is as
			    elusive as it is effusive, making it difficult for authority to harness.
			    Perhaps this is because, as Forster reminds us, the threat of force is the
			    foundation of government, while such intuitive decency is an altruistic
			    quality that is the antithesis of physical violence.
			</p>
			<p>
			    People have vastly different opinions on the state of the nation today, but
			    in general there is undeniable tension on a national and global level. In
			    times that are as divisive as ours, there is the frequent but politicized
			    rallying cry for unity. To me, President Donald Trump’s call for “total
			    allegiance to the United States of America” feels empty and frightening not
			    just because of my dislike for our new leader but also because vapid
			    nationalism is transferrable to any nation on earth, democracy or
			    otherwise. It often holds authoritarian regimes together; without it
			    Vladimir Putin would not have an 83 percent approval rating. One of the
			    characteristics of democracies is a reflexive division and fragmentation,
			    and we should revel in the contrarian clamor, however partisan.
			</p>
			<p>
			    When a good friend of mine recently told me that he voted for Trump, my
			    first reaction was to say, “Why do we have such different political views?”
			    The discussion that followed was not angry, nor was it particularly
			    interesting. What is apparent is that friendship made it somewhat pleasant
			    and even funny. Sadly, this is not how national discourse plays out. It is
			    inevitably petty, simplistic and sometimes violent.
			</p>
			<p>
			    A protestor was shot in the days after the inauguration at the University
			    of Washington, and there was a violent protest at the University of
			    California, Berkeley last week. Whether we are entering a new era of
			    violent discourse is not yet clear. If we are, the national debate will
			    only become more simplistic and petty, with finger pointing and accusations
			    of “They started it!” becoming even more common.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At the heart of these developments is how the debate over debate itself has
			    developed. The argument over what divides free speech from hate speech has
			    only intensified in the Trump era and it deserves a much longer discussion
			    than I can give here.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In order to have the intellectual confrontations we crave, at least one
			    group must abstain from physical force and be a champion of common decency.
			    Otherwise, the communities we participate in will be strained to the point
			    where calls for unquestioning American unity will sound appealing rather
			    than terrifying.

			<h1>Verbum Ultimum: Resilience in Community</h1>
			<h3>By: The Dartmouth Editorial Board</h3>			
			<p>
			Wednesday nights at Dartmouth are usually lively. In Greek houses across campus, affiliated women and men congregate for weekly bonding festivities, and crowds of students gather in living rooms to watch a cappella groups perform. The faint sound of music emanating from fraternity basements hangs over Webster Avenue as groups of students brave the Hanover winter nights. Collis Late Night, Domino’s Pizza and Everything But Anchovies see to it that the night doesn’t end until we’ve indulged.
			</p>
			<p>
			Last week was different. On Wednesday night, Webster Avenue was silent enough to hear a pin drop in the snow. The Interfraternity Council had sent out a campus-wide email that all fraternities would be closed for the night. The crowds that would have gathered in fraternity basements instead gathered on Beta Alpha Omega fraternity’s lawn to commemorate the life of Adam Wright ’17, a Beta brother, a friend, a student, a member of our Dartmouth community.
			</p>
			<p>
			At the College, where approximately 4,300 undergraduates inhabit a secluded rural campus quiety located in the middle of nowhere, each person carries a weighty presence. Each of us is closely tied to something: to an organization, a society, our Greek affiliation, our friends, our peers. If every person on Earth is separated by no more than six degrees, then every person on this campus is family.
			</p>
			<p>
			There is a special sense of community at Dartmouth that manifests itself in every type of social situation. First-year trips exposes us to this odd, and arguably cultish, form of camaraderie. This five-day adventure with fellow freshmen welcomes us into Dartmouth’s family, where tutus, crazy hair colors and animal onesies reign.
			</p>
			<p>
			Moreover, this sense of community is fluid enough to fit a diversity of circumstances. The flag burning demonstration on the Green led by Timothy Messen ’18 was a situation that had the potential to become inflammatory, yet it evolved into a dialogue where opposing sides could vocalize their opinions with the guarantee that the other side would listen and respond. GroupMes for Dartmouth organizations are conversational outlets for a healthy combination of crude comedy and honest debate. Workshops, panels and group discussions provide open forums to discuss difficult issues and controversial current events, while dinner conversations between friends provide a similar purpose in a more intimate setting.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Dartmouth community is one that none of us can help but immerse ourselves in. No matter how involved we choose to be, we all contribute to this madness. It’s embedded in our language, exemplified by terms like “Foco,” “tails” and “flair.” We realize just how unusual our learned language is when we’re on the phone with our friends from home and have to translate from the Dartmouth dictionaries that we’ve catalogued in our brains. It’s embedded in our lifestyles, from our “work-hard-play-hard” mentality to our shared battle every fall to survive the freshman plague.
			We, as Dartmouth students, have allowed ourselves to become a part of a collective even as we still manage to maintain a high degree of individuality. We are not just running blind with the pack; we are engineering majors who talk about literature and art majors who know everything about politics. We choose to be a part of the pack for its ability to enrich our lives. We join organizations and make affiliations not for the promise of having friends and people to tag in Facebook photos, but for the conversations and events that make our Dartmouth experiences so life-changing. We immerse ourselves in the collective not just because it guarantees that we will have people to eat dinner with and parties to attend, but because we teach each other empathy and we offer unique narratives.
			</p>
			<p>
			Dartmouth is an inherently communal place, but we are not so collectivized that we lose our individuality. We are a community that is capable of going beyond the surface level. In the wake of Wright’s passing, we saw our Dartmouth community bend under the weight. When grief hits, certain individuals will be affected more than others, but grief touches all parts of a community. The resiliency of this community is deeply rooted and unbreakable because each of us who chooses to be a part of the collective takes a share of the burden. It is far more bearable to be hit by disaster with others who can help carry some of the weight than it is to bear it alone.
			</p>
			<p>
			Dartmouth is many things, but the beauty of Dartmouth transcends the flair that we wear, our beloved cultish rituals and the stateliness of Baker Tower. It comes from the dirt and the grit underneath the centuries-old buildings that our community has worked so hard to keep pristine. There is beauty in admitting that we’re not doing well in a place where there is such high expectation to do well — and there’s beauty in how we feel at the end of a long night as we kick off our shoes and get ready to sleep before another day.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the same communal spaces that we socialize in on weekends, we also share our personal struggles, discuss controversial issues and gather together in solidarity to mourn the loss of a fellow member of our community. The fluidity of the Dartmouth community is what makes us unbreakable in times of distress. While no one is supposed to see the cracks and the peeling paint, this side of our community is the most honest and beautiful perspective that Dartmouth offers because it is a testament to our resiliency in a system that relentlessly pushes us.
