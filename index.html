				<h1>Thoughtful Traditions</h1>
				<h2>Traditions can help us develop community, but they can also harm us.</h2>
				<p class="by-line">By: Ioana Solomon</p>
				<p>As undergraduate advisors in the Choates cluster, my colleagues and I dread few things more than the upcoming weekend. Halloween this year will certainly be scary for us, but in very particular ways. Our own hallways and bathrooms will be far more terrifying than friends in clown costumes and zombie masks, fake blood or pranks involving spooky recordings of laughter or fake spiders. For us, the goose bumps will come from seeing our residents passed out at the bottoms of staircases, kneeling over toilet seats or crying in their rooms. Our shivers will come not from the cold and dark night or from tight shoes and stolen frackets, but from writing report after report, seeing the Safety and Security phone number climb its way up to our list of favorite contacts and cleaning up messes no one will likely even remember making. </p>

				<p> We accept those duties as part of our job, and for the most part, we make an effort not to protest or act like anyone&rsquo;s parent or boss. However, it is difficult for us to ignore the increased number of alcohol-related incidents reported so far this term. With every passing weekend, more and more of our residents wake up hung-over, in Dick&rsquo;s House beds and often with no recollection of the previous night. This upcoming weekend combines Halloween, Homecoming and the long-awaited end to the fraternity ban. While most of campus sees this as an opportunity to disconnect and have fun, part of me cannot help but realize it is also a recipe for disaster. </p>

				<p> At Dartmouth, traditions and rituals play a tremendous role in shaping our identity as a collective, creating closer bonds among students and supporting our individual development. During events like Homecoming, we feel a special fondness towards our cherished, time-honored traditions. They help bring our community closer together, giving us a sense of purpose and uniting us through shared experiences. However, the same traditions and rituals that bring us together can also tear us apart. When they are normalized or excessively glorified, our customs can become dangerous, exclusive and elitist.</p>

				<p> Firstly, freshmen come to Dartmouth and begin to absorb the culture of the campus as they try to find their place within it. It is not hard to admit that our drinking and hook-up culture, transmitted from class to class, is problematic. We create artificial expectations and unrealistic norms, pressuring ourselves to go out, drink and make fools of ourselves every Friday night when many of us would just prefer staying in bed watching Netflix. So much of our dynamic as a community relies on pack-mentality: we feel vulnerable when we are alone and we find strength in groups, regardless of whether the members of those groups truly share our values. When big weekends like Homecoming or Green Key come our way, so many of the students on this campus feel like they need to be out partying even if they would be more comfortable staying warm and sober. These kinds of expectations and social pressures turn what would otherwise be a pleasant celebration of traditions and rituals into a night of ignoring our limits and making choices we later regret. </p>

				<p> On a more profound and less tangible level, Dartmouth traditions and rituals also carry an aura of exclusivity in that they are most often celebrated by elitist groups in elitist spaces. Much of this is unintentional and subtle, but that does not stop it from being real. Traditions and rituals that are commonly practiced by Greek communities and athletic teams certainly have their place at Dartmouth and in our history, but they are also practices that involve only members with a certain level of privilege. Membership in Greek and/or athletic groups often requires a fairly high socioeconomic status, or is subject to criteria which institutionally exclude students of different races, genders, sexual orientations or backgrounds. Consequently, when fraternities and some sororities open their doors to celebrate big weekends like Homecoming, they open their doors only to those who already feel comfortable and welcome in those spaces. Despite an umbrella of inclusion built through campus-wide emails and open invitations, marginalized groups have a hard time finding their place at Dartmouth and celebrating many of its traditions in good faith. </p>

				<p> This year, while we cannot expect to dismantle an entire web of institutional barriers, and while we cannot keep everyone out of danger&rsquo;s way, we at least have the responsibility to try. It is on us to let our traditions and rituals tighten our bonds, make us warmer and kinder to each other and teach us more about ourselves and about each other. It is on us to make this Homecoming a safer, more comfortable and more enjoyable experience for those with whom we share our home.  </p>

				<h1>What is Tradition?</h1>
				<h2>What exactly are traditions and rituals, and what distinguishes them from one another? How do each of these manifest at Dartmouth, during Homecoming and throughout the year?</h2>
				<p class="by-line">By: Anna Staropoli</p>
				<p>A class of more than 1,000 college freshmen &mdash; all garbed in uniform hunter-green t-shirts proudly displaying their class year &mdash; encircles a giant bonfire in the center of the Green. Chants of &ldquo;Touch the fire&rdquo; intertwine with exclamations of &ldquo;Worst class ever,&rdquo; as students, alumni and faculty alike all absorb an experience that is quintessentially, unabashedly Dartmouth.</p>

<p>  This is a Homecoming tradition we have all come to know. This is the Dartmouth that tour guides advertise to prospective students visiting for the first time, the Dartmouth that alumni extol when they circle big weekends on their calendars, the Dartmouth that is simply incomprehensible to anyone who has never been a part of it.</p>

<p> This is how we have come to understand what tradition means. But how often do we think about what makes a practice tradition? What is the line between what is simply an experience and what becomes a greater part of Dartmouth&rsquo;s history?</p>

<p> Often, these traditions evolve.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Tradition is just something you do,&rdquo; Spring Yu &rsquo;19 said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not super set in stone; it can change.&rdquo;</p>

<p> She notes, however, that traditions have one common factor.</p>

<p> &ldquo;They&rsquo;re important for the social well-being of x-y-z society.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Traditions are valuable to societies because they foster unity, according to anthropology professor John Watanabe. By equalizing otherwise uncommon individuals, traditions create a sense of community and cohesion.</p>

<p> To film and media studies professor William Phillips &rsquo;71, a tradition is something an institution practices for an extended period of time &mdash; an experience that extends to a widespread, institutive group. Phillips contrasts traditions with rituals, which he sees as individual habits rather than common, historically generalized practices.</p>

<p> &ldquo;A ritual might be something that you personally do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like brushing your teeth after you eat breakfast or taking a shower before or after you shave.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Phillips&rsquo; definition represents a common understanding of rituals &mdash; an understanding Watanabe emphasizes as misinformed. He classifies Phillips&rsquo; definition as ritualization rather than ritual.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Rituals are highly formalized acts that people engage in and aren&rsquo;t making them up as they go along,&rdquo; Watanabe said. &ldquo;Some superordinate authority or some authority in the past has dictated these things, and you try to conform to them as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Within this definition, a key difference between traditions and rituals emerges: traditions signify habits of history rather than appointed patterns of action.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Traditions are things that emerge out of and continue out of force of habit,&rdquo; Watanabe said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re things people have always done.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Thus, tradition, ritualization and ritual are marked by varying degrees of self-consciousness and formalism. According to Watanabe, tradition is minimally formal and self-conscious &mdash; individuals follow routines out of comfort and conformity. Tradition becomes ritualization as people gain self-consciousness and believe they must abide by specific actions to feel comfortable. Once these individuals rely on their actions to avoid facing consequences, ritualization shifts to ritual.</p>

<p> Both tradition and ritual surface during Homecoming. Homecoming is clearly a tradition, yet the bonfire corresponds more closely to Watanabe&rsquo;s definition of ritual. The bonfire and all it entails &mdash; the freshmen sweep, the number of laps, the first year building of the fire, the parade for alum &mdash; always occur during Homecoming, implying a ritual-like necessity to continue them.</p>

<p> &ldquo;If that doesn&rsquo;t happen, then somehow it isn&rsquo;t quite Homecoming,&rdquo; Watanabe said, &ldquo;People are more self-conscious about having to replicate it even if it&rsquo;s just something that we&rsquo;ve always done.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Aside from Homecoming, other traditions and rituals have made their mark on Dartmouth. As both an alumnus and a professor, Phillips has seen his fair share of both.</p>

<p> One of these, Phillips noted, occurred during graduation. When Dartmouth was still an all-male institution, the graduating class would gather by the Bema and smoke a clay pipe together.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I think maybe I skipped that,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p> Phillips recalled another ritual which today&rsquo;s administration would certainly prohibit. During his time at Dartmouth, freshmen were required to wear beanies daily.</p>

<p> &ldquo;If an upperclassman caught you without your beanie, they could send you back to your room,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p> To avoid this beanie hazing, a tug of war competition occurred early in the term. The contest pitted upperclassmen against freshmen, who, if victorious, no longer needed to don the green caps. If they lost, however, freshmen were expected to wear the hats until mid-November. Such was the case in 1963, when following a loss, the freshmen organized a protest through the dining hall. Yet despite this protest, the tradition continued until 1973.</p>

<p> For all the traditions that have faded, many new ones have cropped up. The Ledyard Challenge &mdash; in which students swim naked to Vermont and then sprint back to Hanover &mdash; only appeared in recent years.</p>

<p> Several new Homecoming activities have been developed in recent years. When Phillips attended Dartmouth, he and his class did not run laps around the bonfire; rather, the Class of 1971 had a bonfire at every home game.</p>

<p> &ldquo;We built it ourselves,&rdquo; Phillips said about the bonfire. &ldquo;The tradition was that whichever class you were was how big your bonfire was. So we had to have 71 tiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p> One aspect of today&rsquo;s Homecoming &mdash; rushing the field &mdash; has persisted, although in Phillips&rsquo; time, the activity had slightly higher stakes.</p>

<p> &ldquo;The cops would chase the freshmen around,&rdquo; Phillips mused. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d call that a tradition &mdash; a wacky tradition.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Some, however, are less enchanted with the idea of tradition. Charles Springer &rsquo;17 defines traditions and rituals as one and the same and believes that Dartmouth overstresses their importance.</p>

<p> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this big emphasis on the word tradition here,&rdquo; Springer said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that people should do things just because it&rsquo;s the tradition.&rdquo;</p>

<p> As traditions age, many became antiquated and some are eventually seen as unsuitable or inappropriate. Naturally, looking back on Dartmouth&rsquo;s 250-year history, some traditions evoke negative reactions.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think rituals are all that great,&rdquo; Springer confessed. &ldquo;You can find a sense of camaraderie in them, but I think they bring more harm than good.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Springer contends that traditions may exploit or abuse people, pointing to old-fashioned traditions that recirculate racist or misogynistic ideology.</p>

<p> &ldquo;They&rsquo;re often used to justify things that aren&rsquo;t pragmatically expedient or are just flat-out wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very against the focus on tradition here.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Stories from Phillips&rsquo; time reaffirm the idea that not all traditions are worth keeping.</p>

<p> During his freshman year, Phillips and his roommates hung a banner in their room that they&rsquo;d purchased at the Dartmouth Co-Op. Written on the banner were the words &ldquo;When better women are made, Dartmouth men will make them.&rdquo; This slogan protested the push for co-education, as the College contemplated breaking with its tradition of male-only education. Today, the words on that banner are a reminder that traditions are grounded in time and often require periodical rethinking.</p>

<p> The Dartmouth Indian &ndash; the College&rsquo;s unofficial mascot since the 1920s &ndash; had fallen under heavy criticism by the 1970s. In 1974, the College opted to discontinue the use of the symbol, as the Board of Trustees found its use &ldquo;inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education.&rdquo;</p>

<p> While it may be best for some traditions to die out, others will burn a little longer. The Homecoming bonfire has been praised by both current and past Dartmouth students. Springer says that despite his misgivings about tradition, the Homecoming bonfire signifies one tradition he hopes never leaves Dartmouth.</p>

<p> Yu echoes this sentiment, remarking that Homecoming represents Dartmouth&rsquo;s unparalleled exuberance for tradition.</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty positive tradition,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a weird &lsquo;come, let&rsquo;s get together and celebrate.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
